# Question

When is it appropriate to use the `"*"` path for a `Route` in React Router?

# Answer
This can easily be accomplished using the `"*"` catch-all route. If none of the previous <Route> had a matching `path`, then this `"*"` will match.

Yes, `"*"` will route you to the not found page if the Route is not found.
