# Question

Is ReactRouter a package for **client-side routing** or **server-side routing**?

# Answer
`React Router` is a package for handling `client-side routing` in a React application and lets us simulate navigation between different "pages" in our application.

    What do we mean by "simulate navigation"?

Normally, when we click on a link like...
```html
<a href="./home.html">Home</a>
```
...we are redirected to a separate HTML page that our browser needs to fetch from the server.
