# Question

With React Router, which of the following path(s) will match the `/products/:id` path?

1. `/products`
2. `/products/apple`
3. `/products/5`
4. `/products/5/about`

Explain your answer.

# Answer
3 - because the `id` portion of the path is a string, therefore also being 2?. I wanna say 2 and 3 only because the previous question asked about the data stype which is techinally a string, and a number stored IN a string
